# Shopify Admin API app to load quantities to metafields

This application connects directly to the Shopify store and its task is to separate the inventory and gain front-end access to the availability of products in different locations separately.

.env file requires:

API_KEY  
API_SECRET_KEY  
SHOP  
PORT  

All these variables can be taken from Shopify Private App.
